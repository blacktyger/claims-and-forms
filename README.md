The USD value calculation of trades after 12 March is based on the EPIC/BTC and BTC/USD price when executed. This calculation represents the loss to be compensated with EIOU tokens.

For those who sent EPIC coins after 12 March to Vitex and lost them permamently there will be compensation based on fixed average EPIC price during 'hack period' - 0.5$ at the moment, it may change.

Each case must be manually investigated to validate Mimblewimble transactions correlated to your account. 

Miners also can claim for EIOU compensation, but due to complicated nature of this task mining compensation requires evidence of losses incurred by the miner. Screenshots, receipts (rented mining power, electric bills, etc), log files, etc may all be considered in analysis. The community volunteer team will fact check submissions and may ask further questions.
